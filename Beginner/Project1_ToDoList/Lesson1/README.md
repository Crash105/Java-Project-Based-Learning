# Lesson 1: Introduction to Java and Setting Up the Environment

Welcome to your first lesson in the Beginner To-Do App project! In this lesson, we will cover the basics of Java and guide you through setting up your development environment.

## Objectives
- Understand what Java is and its features.
- Set up the Java Development Kit (JDK).
- Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## What is Java?
Java is a popular, high-level programming language known for its portability, object-oriented features, and robust community support. Java applications can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, making it a versatile choice for developers.

### Key Features of Java
- **Platform Independence**: Write once, run anywhere (WORA).
- **Object-Oriented**: Emphasizes reusability and modularity.
- **Strongly Typed**: Enforces strict type checking.
- **Rich API**: Offers a wide range of built-in libraries.
- **Multi-threaded**: Supports concurrent execution.

## Setting Up the Environment

### Step 1: Install the Java Development Kit (JDK)
1. Go to the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Download the JDK for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Follow the installation instructions for your specific OS.

### Step 2: Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
An IDE provides tools for writing, debugging, and managing your code. Some popular Java IDEs include:
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: A powerful IDE with extensive features.
- **Eclipse**: A popular open-source IDE with a wide range of plugins.
- **NetBeans**: An easy-to-use IDE for beginners.

#### IntelliJ IDEA Installation
1. Go to the [IntelliJ IDEA download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
2. Download the Community Edition (free) for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions.

#### Eclipse Installation
1. Go to the [Eclipse download page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
2. Download the IDE for Java Developers.
3. Follow the installation instructions.

### Step 3: Verify Your Installation
To verify that Java and your IDE are installed correctly, follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   java -version
   ```
   You should see the installed version of Java.
3. Open your IDE and create a new Java project.

## Conclusion
In this lesson, you learned what Java is, its key features, and how to set up your development environment. In the next lesson, we will dive into Java syntax and data types. 

### Next Steps
- Complete the installation of JDK and your chosen IDE.
- Familiarize yourself with the IDE interface.

Happy coding!
