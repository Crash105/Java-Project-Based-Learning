### Lesson 12: Final To-Do App Enhancements

Congratulations on reaching the final lesson of the Beginner To-Do App project! In this lesson, you‚Äôll focus on polishing your application and adding any final features to enhance its functionality.

---

### üìù Key Concepts:
- **User Interface Improvements**: Enhance the user experience through better prompts and outputs.
- **Additional Features**: Add any desired features that can make your app more useful.
- **Code Refactoring**: Clean up your code for better readability and performance.

---

### Suggested Enhancements:

1. **Sorting Tasks**:
   - Allow users to sort tasks based on their completion status or alphabetically.

2. **Due Dates**:
   - Enable users to set due dates for tasks and display them when viewing the task list.

3. **Search Functionality**:
   - Implement a search feature that allows users to find tasks based on keywords.

4. **Improve User Interface**:
   - Add more descriptive messages to help users understand what to do next.
   - Format the output of tasks to make it more readable.

5. **Exception Handling**:
   - Improve error handling in your application to manage user input more gracefully.

### Example Code Snippets:

1. **Sorting Tasks**:
   - Modify your `viewTasks` method to display tasks in a sorted manner.

```java
import java.util.Collections;

public void viewTasks() {
    if (tasks.isEmpty()) {
        System.out.println("No tasks in the list.");
    } else {
        Collections.sort(tasks);
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.size(); i++) {
            System.out.println((i + 1) + ". " + tasks.get(i));
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Due Dates**:
   - Create a new class `Task` to hold task details along with a due date.

```java
import java.util.Date;

public class Task {
    private String name;
    private Date dueDate;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}
```

3. **Search Functionality**:
   - Add a method in `TodoListManager` to search tasks by keyword.

```java
public void searchTasks(String keyword) {
    for (T task : tasks) {
        if (task.toString().contains(keyword)) {
            System.out.println("Found task: " + task);
        }
    }
}
```

### üöÄ Your Task

1. **Implement Enhancements**:
   - Choose any of the suggested enhancements or create your own to improve your To-Do App.

2. **Testing**:
   - Thoroughly test your application after implementing changes to ensure everything works as expected.

3. **Prepare for Deployment**:
   - Consider how you would package and share your application, even if just for personal use.

### Final Thoughts

Congratulations on completing the Beginner To-Do App project! You‚Äôve gained valuable experience in Java programming, OOP concepts, collections, generics, and file I/O. This foundation will serve you well as you move on to more advanced projects.

### Next Steps
- **Explore Advanced Topics**: Consider diving into topics such as JavaFX for GUI development, Spring for web applications, or database management with JDBC.
- **Build More Projects**: Apply what you‚Äôve learned by creating more complex applications.
