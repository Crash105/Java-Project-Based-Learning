## üîß Requirements

Each project may have different requirements depending on its level of complexity. Below are the basic tools and software you need to install based on the project you are working on:

### 1. **General Requirements (All Levels)**

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: You'll need to have Java installed on your machine to compile and run the Java programs.
  - **Download JDK**: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
  - Make sure to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and add the `bin` directory to your `PATH`.

- **IDE**: You can use any IDE or text editor for writing and running Java code. Here are some options:
  - **IntelliJ IDEA**: [Download IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
  - **Eclipse**: [Download Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
  - **VS Code with Java Extensions**: [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

### 2. **Intermediate Requirements**

- **MySQL**: For projects like the Library Management System, you‚Äôll need a MySQL database to store and manage data.
  - **Download MySQL**: [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
  - You can also use **XAMPP** or **MAMP** for local development with MySQL.

- **JDBC Driver**: If you are using MySQL, you'll need the MySQL JDBC driver to connect Java to your database.
  - **Download MySQL JDBC Connector**: [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)

### 3. **Advanced & Web Development Requirements**

- **Spring Boot**: For building web applications, you will need Spring Boot and the associated dependencies. Most dependencies will be managed using Maven or Gradle.
  - **Spring Boot Documentation**: [https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  - Maven is required to manage dependencies for Spring Boot projects. [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

- **Postman or REST Client**: For testing REST APIs built using Spring Boot, you can use Postman or any REST client of your choice.
  - **Download Postman**: [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

- **Node.js & NPM (for Final Project)**: If you‚Äôre working on the full-stack task management app, you'll need Node.js and NPM for the front-end.
  - **Download Node.js**: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
